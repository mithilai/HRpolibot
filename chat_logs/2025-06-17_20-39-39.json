    "question": "what is sandwich rule ?",
    "answer": "The sandwich rule states that if a weekly off or Paid Holiday falls in between two leaves (either full days or half days), it will be counted towards the leaves. For example, if you take leave on Friday and Monday, the weekend (Saturday and Sunday) will also be counted as part of your leave. This applies to both full-day leaves and half-day leaves."
