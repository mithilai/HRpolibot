    "question": "what is sandwich rule",
    "answer": "The sandwich rule applies when a weekly off or Paid Holiday falls between two leaves (full days or half days). In this case, the weekly off or Paid Holiday will be counted towards the leaves. \n\nFor example:\n- If you take leave on Friday and Monday, the Saturday and Sunday in between will be counted as part of your leave.\n- If you take a half-day leave on Friday and another half-day leave on Monday, the Saturday and Sunday in between will also be counted as part of your leave."
