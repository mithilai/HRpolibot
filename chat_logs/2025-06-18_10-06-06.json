Here are the key points about EL:\n\n* EL is generally taken for vacation, family outing, leisure, or to relax and have fun with family and friends.\n* It can also be applied for own marriage, close members' death rituals, or any kind of long-term emergency, along with marriage or bereavement leave.\n* EL can be applied if a member doesn't have balance Casual Leave (CL) available in their account, but it will have clauses applicable to CL, such as not applying more than 2 CL's at a stretch.\n* EL encashment will be done on Basic Salary, not Gross Salary.\n* EL will be carried forward to the next year if not availed in a particular year, based on the calculation given by the HR team.\n* EL can be encashed at the end of the year, and the balance EL will be carried forward.\n* In case of resignation, EL will not be credited to the member's account during the notice period, and the balanced EL will be encashed in the Full & Final Settlement.\n* EL application requires a minimum of 2 days, and medical certificates or doctor's reports may be required for approval.\n* EL encashment and carry forward will be done on a yearly basis based on the formula set by HR."
