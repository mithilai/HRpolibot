    "content": "The sandwich rule applies to leaves. According to the policy, if a weekly off or Paid Holiday falls in between two leaves, it will be counted towards the leaves. This is known as a \"sandwich leave\".\n\nFor example, if you take a leave on Friday and another leave on Monday, the weekend (Saturday and Sunday) will also be counted as part of your leave.\n\nSimilarly, if you take a half-day leave on Friday and another half-day leave on Monday, the weekend will also be counted as part of your leave.\n\nIn both cases, the weekly off or Paid Holiday (Saturday and Sunday) is \"sandwiched\" between two leaves, hence the name \"sandwich leave\"."
